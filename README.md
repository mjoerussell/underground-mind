# Underground Mind U/M

## Getting Started

This is a React Native application.  Before getting started, make sure you have intalled [Expo Cli](https://docs.expo.io/versions/v30.0.0/introduction/installation).

Install the Expo app on [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=host.exp.exponent) or [iOS](https://search.itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZContentLink.woa/wa/link?path=apps%2fexponent).

In the command line, run `expo register` to create an Expo account.  Once you have an account, run `npm start` to start the development server and then check the Expo app for a link to the current project.  `npm start` will also open a developer console in your default browser.
